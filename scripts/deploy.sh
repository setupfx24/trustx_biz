  --no-pull        Skip 'git pull origin main'
  --no-build       Skip docker compose build (use existing images)
  --no-migrate     Skip Alembic upgrade head. Only use when you know
                   the DB is already on the right revision — leaving
                   migrations un-applied is the #1 cause of post-deploy
                   502s (gateway crashes on first query against a
                   missing column).
  --service <n>    Limit the BUILD step to specific service(s); the up
                   step always brings the full stack up. Repeatable.

Examples:
  $0                                    # full deploy (rebuild + migrate + up everything)
  $0 --service trader-frontend          # rebuild just trader-frontend, up the full stack
  $0 --no-build --service gateway       # skip build entirely (--service is a no-op here)
  $0 --no-migrate                       # rebuild + up, skip Alembic
