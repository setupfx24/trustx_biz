"""Fixed Return — user principal locks against an admin-tunable rate matrix.

Rates and the early-withdrawal fee live in ``system_settings`` (JSON +
percent), not in dedicated tables, so admins can change the matrix in
one form without schema churn.

Money flow:
  Lock     : user.main_wallet_balance -= principal; row state='active'.
  Mature   : automatic at matures_at — principal + (principal * rate%)
             credited back to main_wallet_balance, state='matured'.
  Early    : principal * (1 - fee%) credited back; no return earned;
             state='withdrawn_early'.

    """A user-locked principal with periodic interest payouts.

    Tenure now controls the PAYOUT CADENCE (Month / Quarter / Half-Year
    / Year / 2-Year), not the lock duration. Lock duration is a single
    admin-set policy (default 24 months) captured at creation in
    ``lock_months_at_creation`` so changing the policy later doesn't
    silently re-price open positions.

    Lifecycle:
      - On create     : matures_at = locked_at + lock_months_at_creation,
                        next_payout_at = locked_at + tenure_days.
