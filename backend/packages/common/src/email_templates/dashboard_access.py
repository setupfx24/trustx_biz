"""Dashboard-access email — sent after the trader finishes the profile-
completion gate (Save & Continue). Distinct from the verify-email message
that fires at signup: this one welcomes the trader into the platform and
hands them a one-click button to open the dashboard.

The link is just a deep URL into the trader app (`/accounts`). The user is
already authenticated in their original browser session via HttpOnly
cookies, so clicking it lands them on the dashboard. On a different
device, the trader app's auth guard will bounce them through /auth/login
first — same behaviour as any other deep link.
