"""Admin-triggered server maintenance broadcast — sent to every active
user before a scheduled downtime window so trades, withdrawals, and
deposits aren't surprised by an outage.

Subject/body are templated but the admin can override both via the
broadcast form. Window times are formatted as the caller provides them
(usually a UTC ISO string the admin already rendered for display).
