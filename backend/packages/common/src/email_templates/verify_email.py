"""Sign-up verification email — focused, single-purpose.

Earlier versions bundled welcome / onboarding content (capability bullets,
credentials block, "Why Trade with Trustx" list) into this email so the
trader got one rich message instead of two back-to-back. The client
flagged that the welcome flavour buried the verify CTA and felt
mismatched for the moment — at signup the user just needs to confirm
ownership of their inbox; welcome content makes more sense once they're
actually inside the app. Layout is intentionally minimal: greeting,
one-line ask, the green CTA, expiry note, and the standard "ignore if
you didn't sign up" reassurance.

The signed token in `verify_url` is a JWT with type=email_verify and a
24-hour expiry — see auth_service._build_verify_url.
