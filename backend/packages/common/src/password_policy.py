"""Password-strength policy — server-side source of truth.

Mirrors frontend/trader/src/lib/passwordPolicy.ts. If you change a
rule here, update the frontend too — the frontend gives the user
real-time feedback before submit, but the backend is what actually
rejects weak passwords. Either layer alone is insufficient: client
checks can be bypassed, server-only checks frustrate the user with
"submit → fail → retry" loops.

Rules:
  1. Minimum 8 characters (hard floor)
  2. At least 3 of these 4 character classes: lower / upper / digit / symbol
  3. Not in the COMMON_WEAK_PASSWORDS blocklist
  4. Not a substring match against user-supplied disallow strings
     (typically the email local-part + first / last name)

A password that satisfies all four is accepted. Anything else raises
PasswordTooWeak with a short message the caller can return to the
client.
