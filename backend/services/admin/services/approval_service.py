"""4-eyes approval helper for high-value financial admin actions.

Rule:
  * Any add_fund / deduct_fund / withdrawal_approve at or above
    settings.ADMIN_DUAL_APPROVAL_THRESHOLD requires a second admin to
    approve before the original admin's request is executed.
  * The same admin who created the request CANNOT approve it
    (enforced both here and by a CHECK constraint on the table).
  * Above settings.ADMIN_BALANCE_MUTATION_CAP the action is rejected
    outright — no admin can move that much in a single operation,
    even with two signatures. (Defense-in-depth against compromised
    super_admin.)
