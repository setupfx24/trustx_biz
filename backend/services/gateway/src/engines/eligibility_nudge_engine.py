"""Eligibility-nudge engine.

Watches for users who are funded enough to benefit from Fixed Return /
Trade Insurance but haven't been emailed about either product. Picks
the right flavor based on activity:

  * fr        — balance >= $250 AND no trades in the last 14 days
                (idle cash, FR is the better fit)
  * insurance — balance >= $250 AND >= 5 trades in the last 14 days
                (active trader, Insurance is the better fit)
  * both      — both criteria true (funded + active), pitch both

Re-sends every 90 days while still eligible so the nudge stays relevant
without becoming spam. Idempotent — users.fr_insurance_nudge_sent_at
gates the resend cohort.
