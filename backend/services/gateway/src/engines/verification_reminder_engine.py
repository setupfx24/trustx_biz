"""KYC verification reminder engine.

Sends the first nudge 24 hours after signup if KYC isn't complete, then
re-nudges every 7 days for as long as the user stays in pending /
rejected. Each send updates ``users.kyc_last_reminded_at`` so a deploy
mid-day never double-mails the same user.

(The old 3-day/7-day "stage" counter was bounded — stopped emailing
after stage 2. Client wants the platform to keep nudging.)

Idempotent on the engine side: tick hourly, but the SQL filter only
returns users whose kyc_last_reminded_at is older than the threshold
for their current cohort.
