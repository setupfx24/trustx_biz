            Trading foreign exchange (forex) and other leveraged financial products carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors. Leverage can work both for and against you — while it amplifies potential profits, it equally amplifies potential losses. You could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with leveraged trading and seek independent financial advice if you have any doubts. Past performance is not indicative of future results.
