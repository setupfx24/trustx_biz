  {
    q: "What is the minimum deposit required to start trading?",
    a: "Only $50. A $50 first deposit unlocks the Standard live account or the IB partner account; ECN starts at $200. A free Demo account with $100,000 in virtual funds is also available — no commitment. Every first deposit also receives a 100% Welcome Bonus (up to $200).",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I get the 100% Welcome Bonus?",
    a: "The 100% Welcome Bonus is applied automatically to your first qualifying deposit — no promo code required. Deposit $100 → get a $100 bonus; deposit $200 → get a $200 bonus. The bonus is fully tradeable from the moment it lands in your account. See the /bonus page for the full tier breakdown.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which deposit and withdrawal methods are available, and how long do they take?",
    a: "We support bank wire transfers, Visa/Mastercard, Skrill, Neteller, and cryptocurrency. UPI is supported as a deposit payment option for traders in India. Card and e-wallet deposits are typically instant; bank wires and crypto withdrawals usually settle within 1–3 business days.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which trading platforms and devices are supported?",
    a: "Trustx offers a fast web platform accessible from any modern browser, plus dedicated iOS and Android mobile apps. All platforms sync to a single account, so your positions, alerts, and watchlists stay in sync across every device.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is Fixed Return?",
    a: "Fixed Return is a capital-protected investment product where you lock your principal for a defined tenure (Month, Quarter, Half-Year, Year, or 2 Year) and earn a known, fixed return paid at maturity. Returns scale with deposit size and tenure — from 1% per month on a $1K Monthly plan to 7% on a $50K+ 2-Year plan. Your principal is held in a segregated trust account and returned in full at maturity. See the Products → Fixed Return Insurance page for the full rate matrix.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does the Decentralized Exchange work?",
    a: "Trustx DEX lets you trade directly from your own wallet with non-custodial, on-chain execution. You keep your private keys, your funds never leave your wallet, and every order is settled through smart contracts — no counterparty risk, no withdrawal queues. Connect MetaMask, WalletConnect, or any EVM-compatible wallet, sign the trade, and the swap clears on-chain in seconds.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I insure my trades?",
    a: "Trade Insurance is built into every position on trustx. Each open trade is policy-backed by on-chain insurance up to the policy limit. If the market moves against you beyond the defined threshold, the insured amount is paid out automatically by the smart-contract underwriter. The insurance does not cover market loss within the policy threshold, so always size positions to your own risk tolerance.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I apply for the IB program?",
    a: "Visit Products → IB Referral and fill out the short partner application (name, country, email, phone, and a brief note about your audience). Our partner team reviews and activates accounts within 24 hours. Once approved you receive a unique referral link plus a marketing kit, and you start earning weekly per-lot commissions (up to $7 / lot at Platinum tier) on every trade your referrals place — for life.",
